            of Wellness genomic, clinical, precision medicine and
            cross-disciplinary data that enables healthcare transformation.
            Delivering population genome program across the GCC and beyond, in
            partnership with governments and health authorities, we pave the way
            for personalized and preventive healthcare delivery through
            precision medicine, and standardized viral sequencing to ensure data
            reliability across populations. We also offer Next-Generation
            Sequencing technology, generating the highest quality and the most
            comprehensive genome data and biological insights. At G42
            Healthcare, we deliver the highest capacity combined sequencing
            throughput of over 40,000 genomes per month â€“ the highest capacity
            globally. At our facilities, we harness advanced AI technology
            capabilities by integrating large, erse data sets to deliver
            valuable insights for R&D and improved outcomes as part of clinical
            and consumer genomics solutions, thus unlocking the power of the
            genome even further.
